Monopond Fax API PHP Client

#Building a Request
To use Monopond SOAP PHP Client, start by including the `MonopondSOAPClient.php` then creating an instance of the client by supplying your credentials. Your username and password should be enclosed in quotation marks.

```php
<?php
     include_once './MonopondSOAPClient.php';
     
     // TODO: Enter your own credentials here
     $client = new MonopondSOAPClientV2("myusername", "mypassword", MPENV::PRODUCTION);
     
     // TODO: Set up your request here
 ?>
```

## SendFax
### Description
This is the core function in the API allowing you to send faxes on the platform. 

Your specific faxing requirements will dictate which send request type below should be used. The two common use cases would be the sending of a single fax document to one destination and the sending of a single fax document to multiple destinations.

### Sending a single fax:
To send a fax to a single destination a request similar to the following example can be used:

```php
	// TODO: Put your file path here
	$filedata = fread(fopen("tests/sample.txt", "r"), filesize("tests/sample.txt"));
	$filedata = base64_encode($filedata);
    
	// TODO: Setup Document
	$document = new MonopondDocument();
	$document->FileName = "AnyFileName1.txt";
	$document->FileData = $filedata;
	$document->Order = 0;
     
	// TODO: Setup FaxMessage
	$faxMessage = new MonopondFaxMessage();
	$faxMessage->MessageRef = "Testing-message-1";
	$faxMessage->SendTo = "61011111111";
	$faxMessage->Documents = array($document);
     
	// TODO: Setup FaxSendRequest 
	$sendFaxRequest = new MonopondSendFaxRequest();
	$sendFaxRequest->FaxMessages[] = $faxMessage;

	// Call send fax method
	$sendRespone = $client->sendFax($sendFaxRequest);
	print_r($sendRespone);
```

* [MonopondSendFaxRequest Properties](#monopondsendfaxrequest-properties)

### Sending a Fax with Retries inside a FaxMessage
To set-up a fax to have retries a request similar to the following example can be used.

```php
 	// TODO: Put your file path here
    $filedata = fread(fopen("tests/sample.txt", "r"), filesize("tests/sample.txt"));
    $filedata = base64_encode($filedata);
    
    /* Setup Documents */
    $document = new MonopondDocument();
    $document->FileName = "AnyFileName1.txt";
    $document->FileData = $filedata;
    $document->Order = 0;
    
    /* Setup FaxMessages (Each contains an array of document objects) */
    $faxMessage = new MonopondFaxMessage();
    $faxMessage->MessageRef = "Testing-message-1";
    $faxMessage->SendTo = "61011111111";
    $faxMessage->Retries = 0;
    
    /* Setup FaxSendRequest (Each contains an array of fax messages) */
    $sendFaxRequest = new MonopondSendFaxRequest();
    $sendFaxRequest->FaxMessages[] = $faxMessage;
    $sendFaxRequest->Documents = array($document);

    /* Send request to Monopond */
    $sendRespone = $client->sendFax($sendFaxRequest);
    /* Display response */
    print_r($sendRespone);
```

### Sending a Fax with Retries inside a SendFaxRequest
To set-up a fax to have retries a request similar to the following example can be used.
```php
    // TODO: Put your file path here
    $filedata = fread(fopen("tests/sample.txt", "r"), filesize("tests/sample.txt"));
    $filedata = base64_encode($filedata);
    
    /* Setup Documents */
    $document = new MonopondDocument();
    $document->FileName = "AnyFileName1.txt";
    $document->FileData = $filedata;
    $document->Order = 0;
    
    /* Setup FaxMessages (Each contains an array of document objects) */

    $sendFaxRequest = new MonopondSendFaxRequest();
    $sendFaxRequest->FaxMessages[] = $faxMessage;
    $sendFaxRequest->Documents = array($document);
    $sendFaxRequest->Retries = 1;

    /* Send request to Monopond */
    $sendRespone = $client->sendFax($sendFaxRequest);
    /* Display response */
    print_r($sendRespone);

### Sending a Fax with BusyRetries inside a FaxMessage
To set-up a fax to have busyRetries a request similar to the following example can be used.
```php
    // TODO: Put your file path here
    $filedata = fread(fopen("tests/sample.txt", "r"), filesize("tests/sample.txt"));
    $filedata = base64_encode($filedata);
    
    /* Setup Documents */
    $document = new MonopondDocument();
    $document->FileName = "AnyFileName1.txt";
    $document->FileData = $filedata;
    $document->Order = 0;
    
    /* Setup FaxMessages (Each contains an array of document objects) */
    $faxMessage = new MonopondFaxMessage();
    $faxMessage->MessageRef = "Testing-message-1";
    $faxMessage->SendTo = "61011111111";
    $faxMessage->BusyRetries = 1;
    
    /* Setup FaxSendRequest (Each contains an array of fax messages) */
    $sendFaxRequest = new MonopondSendFaxRequest();
    $sendFaxRequest->FaxMessages[] = $faxMessage;
    $sendFaxRequest->Documents = array($document);

    /* Send request to Monopond */
    $sendRespone = $client->sendFax($sendFaxRequest);
    /* Display response */
    print_r($sendRespone);

* [MonopondSendFaxRequest Properties](#monopondsendfaxrequest-properties)

### Sending multiple faxes:
To send faxes to multiple destinations a request similar to the following example can be used. Please note the addition of another “FaxMessage”:

```php
// TODO: Put your file path here
 $filedata = fread(fopen("./test.txt", "r"), filesize("./test.txt"));
 $filedata = base64_encode($filedata);
 
 // TODO: Setup Document
 $document = new MonopondDocument();
 $document->FileName = "AnyFileName1.txt";
 $document->FileData = $filedata;
 $document->Order = 0;
 $document2 = new MonopondDocument();
 $document2->FileName = "AnyFileName2.txt";
 $document2->FileData = $filedata;
 $document2->Order = 0;
 
 $document3 = new MonopondDocument();
 $document3->FileName = "AnyFileName3.txt";
 $document3->FileData = $filedata;
 $document3->Order = 0;
 
 // TODO: Setup FaxMessage
 $faxMessage = new MonopondFaxMessage();
 $faxMessage->MessageRef = "Testing-message-1";
 $faxMessage->SendTo = "61011111111";
 $faxMessage->SendFrom = "Test Fax";
 $faxMessage->Documents = array($document);
 $faxMessage->Resolution = "normal";
 $faxMessage->Retries = 0;
 $faxMessage->BusyRetries = 2;
 $faxMessage2 = new MonopondFaxMessage();
 $faxMessage2->MessageRef = "Testing-message-2";
 $faxMessage2->SendTo = "61011111111";
 $faxMessage2->SendFrom = "Test Fax 2";
 $faxMessage2->Documents = array($document $document3);
 $faxMessage2->Resolution = "normal";
 $faxMessage2->Retries = 0;
 $faxMessage2->BusyRetries = 3;
 // TODO: Setup FaxSendRequest 
 $sendFaxRequest = new MonopondSendFaxRequest();
 $sendFaxRequest->BroadcastRef = "Broadcast-test-1";
 $sendFaxRequest->SendRef = "Send-Ref-1";
 $sendFaxRequest->FaxMessages[] = $faxMessage;
 $sendFaxRequest->FaxMessages[] = $faxMessage2;
 

 // Call send fax method
 $sendRespone = $client->sendFax($sendFaxRequest);
 print_r($sendRespone);
```

### Sending faxes to multiple destinations with the same document (broadcasting):
To send the same fax content to multiple destinations (broadcasting) a request similar to the example below can be used.

This method is recommended for broadcasting as it takes advantage of the multiple tiers in the send request. This eliminates the repeated parameters out of the individual fax message elements which are instead inherited from the parent send fax request. An example below shows `SendFrom` being used for both FaxMessages. While not shown in the example below further control can be achieved over individual fax elements to override the parameters set in the parent.

When sending multiple faxes in batch it is recommended to group them into requests of around 600 fax messages for optimal performance. If you are sending the same document to multiple destinations it is strongly advised to only attach the document once in the root of the send request rather than attaching a document for each destination.

```php
 // TODO: Put your file path here
 $filedata = fread(fopen("./test.txt", "r"), filesize("./test.txt"));
 $filedata = base64_encode($filedata);
 
 // TODO: Setup Document
 $document = new MonopondDocument();
 $document->FileName = "AnyFileName1.txt";
 $document->FileData = $filedata;
 $document->Order = 0;
 
 // TODO: Setup FaxMessage
 $faxMessage = new MonopondFaxMessage();
 $faxMessage->MessageRef = "Testing-message-1";
 $faxMessage->SendTo = "61011111111";
 $faxMessage2 = new MonopondFaxMessage();
 $faxMessage2->MessageRef = "Testing-message-2";
 $faxMessage2->SendTo = "61011111111";
 // TODO: Setup FaxSendRequest 
 $sendFaxRequest = new MonopondSendFaxRequest();
 $sendFaxRequest->BroadcastRef = "Broadcast-test-1";
 $sendFaxRequest->SendRef = "Send-Ref-1";
 $sendFaxRequest->FaxMessages[] = $faxMessage;
 $sendFaxRequest->FaxMessages[] = $faxMessage2;
 $sendFaxRequest->Documents = array($document);
 $sendFaxRequest->SendFrom = "Test Fax";
 // Call send fax method
 $sendRespone = $client->sendFax($sendFaxRequest);
 print_r($sendRespone);
```

### Sending Microsoft Documents With DocMergeData:
(This request only works in version 2.1(or higher) of the fax-api.)

This request is used to send a Microsoft document with replaceable variables or merge fields. The merge field follows the pattern ```<mf:key>```.  If your key is ```field1```, it should be typed as ```<mf:field1>``` in the document. Note that the key must be unique within the whole document. The screenshots below are examples of what the request does.

Original .doc file:

![before](https://github.com/Monopond/fax-api/raw/master/img/DocMergeData/before.png)

This is what the file looks like after the fields ```field1```,```field2``` and ```field3``` have been replaced with values ```lazy dog```, ```fat pig``` and ```fat pig```:

![stamp](https://github.com/Monopond/fax-api/raw/master/img/DocMergeData/after.png)

##### Sample Request
The example below shows ```field1``` will be replaced by the value of ```Test```.

```php
	// TODO: Put your file path here
    $filedata = fread(fopen("./test.docx", "r"), filesize("./test.docx"));
	$filedata = base64_encode($filedata);

	$mergeField = new MonopondMergeField();
	$mergeField->Key = "name";
	$mergeField->Value = "Raspberry Pi";

	$document1 = new MonopondDocument();
	$document1->DocumentRef = "send-1-document";
	$document1->DocMergeData[] = $mergeField;

	/* Setup FaxMessages (Each contains an array of document objects) */
	$faxMessage = new MonopondFaxMessage();
	$faxMessage->MessageRef = "message-1";
	$faxMessage->SendTo = "61290120211";
	$faxMessage->SendFrom = "Test Fax";
	$faxMessage->Resolution = "normal";
	$faxMessage->Retries = 0;
	$faxMessage->BusyRetries = 2;
	$faxMessage->CLI = 61290120211;
	$faxMessage->Documents = array($document1);

	$mergeField2 = new MonopondMergeField();
	$mergeField2->Key = "name";
	$mergeField2->Value = "Raspberry Pi 2";

	$document2 = new MonopondDocument();
	$document2->DocumentRef = "send-1-document";
	$document2->DocMergeData[] = $mergeField2;

	$faxMessage2->MessageRef = "message-2";
	$faxMessage2->SendTo = "61290120211";
	$faxMessage2->SendFrom = "Test Fax 2";
	$faxMessage2->Resolution = "normal";
	$faxMessage2->Retries = 0;
	$faxMessage2->BusyRetries = 2;
	$faxMessage2->CLI = 61011114111;
	$faxMessage2->Documents = array($document2);

	$baseDocument = new MonopondDocument();
	$baseDocument->DocumentRef = "send-1-document";
	$baseDocument->FileName = "file.docx";
	$baseDocument->FileData = $filedata;
	$baseDocument->Order = 0;

	/* Setup FaxSendRequest (Each contains an array of fax messages) */
	$sendFaxRequest = new MonopondSendFaxRequest();
	$sendFaxRequest->BroadcastRef = "broadcast-1";
	$sendFaxRequest->SendRef = "send-1";
	$sendFaxRequest->HeaderFormat = "Testing";
	$sendFaxRequest->FaxMessages[] = $faxMessage;
	$sendFaxRequest->FaxMessages[] = $faxMessage2;
	$sendFaxRequest->Documents = array($baseDocument);

	/* Send request to Monopond */
    $sendRespone = $client->sendFax($sendFaxRequest);
    /* Display response */
    print_r($sendRespone);
```

### Sending Fax with TimeZone
The Timezone is used to format the datetime display in the fax header.
```php
	// TODO: Put your file path here
    $filedata = fread(fopen("./test.docx", "r"), filesize("./test.docx"));
	$filedata = base64_encode($filedata);

    /* Display response */
    print_r($sendRespone);
```

### Sending Fax with Blocklist
A sample request must be similar to this following code below:

```php
	// TODO: Put your file path here
    $filedata = fread(fopen("./test.docx", "r"), filesize("./test.docx"));
	$filedata = base64_encode($filedata);

	$mergeField = new MonopondMergeField();
	$mergeField->Key = "name";
	$mergeField->Value = "Raspberry Pi";

	$document1 = new MonopondDocument();
	$document1->DocumentRef = "send-1-document";
	$document1->DocMergeData[] = $mergeField;

    $monopondBlocklist = new MonopondBlocklist();
    $monopondBlocklist->dncr = "true";

    $sendRespone = $client->sendFax($sendFaxRequest);
    /* Display response */
    print_r($sendRespone);
```

### Sending Tiff and PDF files with StampMergeData:
(This request only works in version 2.1(or higher) of the fax-api.)

This request allows a PDF or TIFF file to be stamped with an image or text, based on X-Y coordinates. The x and y coordinates (0,0) starts at the top left part of the document. The screenshots below are examples of what the request does.

Original tiff file:

### Response
The response received from a `SendFaxRequest` matches the response you receive when calling the `FaxStatus` method call with a `send` verbosity level.

### SOAP Faults
This function will throw one of the following SOAP faults/exceptions if something went wrong:
**InvalidArgumentsException, NoMessagesFoundException, DocumentContentTypeNotFoundException, or InternalServerException.**
You can find more details on these faults [here](#section5).

## FaxStatus
### Description

This function provides you with a method of retrieving the status, details and results of fax messages sent. While this is a legitimate method of retrieving results we strongly advise that you take advantage of our callback service, which will push these fax results to you as they are completed.

When making a status request, you must provide at least a `BroadcastRef`, `SendRef` or `MessageRef`. The 
function will also accept a combination of these to further narrow the request query.
- Limiting by a `BroadcastRef` allows you to retrieve faxes contained in a group of send requests.
- Limiting by `SendRef` allows you to retrieve faxes contained in a single send request.
- Limiting by `MessageRef` allows you to retrieve a single fax message.

There are multiple levels of verbosity available in the request; these are explained in detail below.

**FaxStatusRequest Properties:**

| **Name** | **Required** | **Type** | **Description** |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | 
|**BroadcastRef**|  | *String* | User-defined broadcast reference. |

## General Properties and File Formatting
### File Encoding
All files are encoded in the Base64 encoding specified in RFC 2045 - MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions). The Base64 encoding is designed to represent arbitrary sequences of octets in a form that need not be humanly readable. A 65-character subset ([A-Za-z0-9+/=]) of US-ASCII is used, enabling 6 bits to be represented per printable character. For more information see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64

### Dates
Dates are always passed in ISO-8601 format with time zone. For example: “2012-07-17T19:27:23+08:00”
