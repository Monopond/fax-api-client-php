Building A Request
To use Monopond SOAP PHP Client, start by including the MonopondSOAPClient.php (line 2) then creating an instance of the client by supplying your credentials (line 5). Your username and password should be enclosed in quotation marks.
1. <?php
2.     include_once './MonopondSOAPClient.php';
3.     
4.     // TODO: Enter your own credentials here
5.     $client = new MonopondSOAPClientV2_1("myusername", "mypassword", MPENV::Production);
6.     
7.     // TODO: Set up your request here
8. ?>


SendFax Request
SendFax Request allows you to send fax/es on the platform.
Sending a single fax:
To send a fax to a single destination, a request similar to the following example can be used:       
1.     // TODO: Put your file path here
2.     $filedata = fread(fopen("./test.txt", "r"), filesize("./test.txt"));
3.     $filedata = base64_encode($filedata);
4.     
5.     // TODO: Setup Document
6.     $document = new MonopondDocument();
7.     $document->FileName = "AnyFileName1.txt";
8.     $document->FileData = $filedata;
9.     $document->Order = 0;
10.  
11.     // TODO: Setup FaxMessage
12.     $faxMessage = new MonopondFaxMessage();
13.     $faxMessage->MessageRef = "Testing-message-1";
14.     $faxMessage->SendTo = "61011111111";
15.     $faxMessage->SendFrom = "Test Fax";
16.     $faxMessage->Documents = array($document);
17.     $faxMessage->Resolution = "normal";
18.     $faxMessage->Retries = 0;
19.     $faxMessage->BusyRetries = 2;
20.     
21.     // TODO: Setup FaxSendRequest 
22.     $sendFaxRequest = new MonopondSendFaxRequest();
23.     $sendFaxRequest->BroadcastRef = "Broadcast-test-1";
24.     $sendFaxRequest->SendRef = "Send-Ref-1";
25.     $sendFaxRequest->FaxMessages[] = $faxMessage;
26. 27.     // Call send fax method
28.     $sendRespone = $client->sendFax($sendFaxRequest);
29.     print_r($sendRespone);

Sending multiple faxes:
To send faxes to multiple destinations, a request similar to the following example can be used. Please note the addition of another “FaxMessage”:
   1.     // TODO: Put your file path here
   2.     $filedata = fread(fopen("./test.txt", "r"), filesize("./test.txt"));
   3.     $filedata = base64_encode($filedata);
   4.     
   5.     // TODO: Setup Document
   6.     $document = new MonopondDocument();
   7.     $document->FileName = "AnyFileName1.txt";
   8.     $document->FileData = $filedata;
   9.     $document->Order = 0;
   10.    11.     $document2 = new MonopondDocument();
   12.     $document2->FileName = "AnyFileName2.txt";
   13.     $document2->FileData = $filedata;
   14.     $document2->Order = 0;
   15.     
   16.     $document3 = new MonopondDocument();
   17.     $document3->FileName = "AnyFileName3.txt";
   18.     $document3->FileData = $filedata;
   19.     $document3->Order = 0;
   20.  
   21.     // TODO: Setup FaxMessage
   22.     $faxMessage = new MonopondFaxMessage();
   23.     $faxMessage->MessageRef = "Testing-message-1";
   24.     $faxMessage->SendTo = "61011111111";
   25.     $faxMessage->SendFrom = "Test Fax";
   26.     $faxMessage->Documents = array($document);
   27.     $faxMessage->Resolution = "normal";
   28.     $faxMessage->Retries = 0;
   29.     $faxMessage->BusyRetries = 2;
   30.    31.     $faxMessage2 = new MonopondFaxMessage();
   32.     $faxMessage2->MessageRef = "Testing-message-2";
   33.     $faxMessage2->SendTo = "61011111111";
   34.     $faxMessage2->SendFrom = "Test Fax 2";
   35.     $faxMessage2->Documents = array($document2, $document3);
   36.     $faxMessage2->Resolution = "normal";
   37.     $faxMessage2->Retries = 0;
   38.     $faxMessage2->BusyRetries = 3;
   39.    40.     // TODO: Setup FaxSendRequest 
   41.     $sendFaxRequest = new MonopondSendFaxRequest();
   42.     $sendFaxRequest->BroadcastRef = "Broadcast-test-1";
   43.     $sendFaxRequest->SendRef = "Send-Ref-1";
   44.     $sendFaxRequest->FaxMessages[] = $faxMessage;
   45.     $sendFaxRequest->FaxMessages[] = $faxMessage2;
   46. 

   1.     // Call send fax method
   2.     $sendRespone = $client->sendFax($sendFaxRequest);
   3.     print_r($sendRespone);


Sending faxes to multiple destinations with the same document (broadcasting):
To send the same fax content to multiple destinations (broadcasting), a request similar to the example below can be used. 
This method is recommended for broadcasting as it takes advantage of the multiple tiers in the send request. This eliminates the repeated parameters out of the individual fax message elements which are instead inherited from the parent send fax request. 


   1.     // TODO: Put your file path here
   2.     $filedata = fread(fopen("./test.txt", "r"), filesize("./test.txt"));
   3.     $filedata = base64_encode($filedata);
   4.     
   5.     // TODO: Setup Document
   6.     $document = new MonopondDocument();
   7.     $document->FileName = "AnyFileName1.txt";
   8.     $document->FileData = $filedata;
   9.     $document->Order = 0;
   10.  
   11.     // TODO: Setup FaxMessage
   12.     $faxMessage = new MonopondFaxMessage();
   13.     $faxMessage->MessageRef = "Testing-message-1";
   14.     $faxMessage->SendTo = "61011111111";
   15.    16.     $faxMessage2 = new MonopondFaxMessage();
   17.     $faxMessage2->MessageRef = "Testing-message-2";
   18.     $faxMessage2->SendTo = "61011111111";
   19.    20.     // TODO: Setup FaxSendRequest 
   21.     $sendFaxRequest = new MonopondSendFaxRequest();
   22.     $sendFaxRequest->BroadcastRef = "Broadcast-test-1";
   23.     $sendFaxRequest->SendRef = "Send-Ref-1";
   24.     $sendFaxRequest->FaxMessages[] = $faxMessage;
   25.     $sendFaxRequest->FaxMessages[] = $faxMessage2;
   26.     $sendFaxRequest->Documents = array($document);
   27.     $sendFaxRequest->SendFrom = "Test Fax";
   28.    29.     // Call send fax method
   30.     $sendRespone = $client->sendFax($sendFaxRequest);
   31.     print_r($sendRespone);

SendFax Response:
The response received from a SendFaxRequest matches the response you receive when calling the FaxStatus method call with a “send” verbosity level.
________________
FaxStatus Request
This function provides you with a method of retrieving the status, details, and results of fax messages sent. While this is a legitimate method of retrieving results, we strongly advise that you take advantage of our callback service, which will push these fax results to you as they are completed.
When making a status request, you must provide at least a BroadcastRef, SendRef, or MessageRef. The function will also accept a combination of these to further narrow the request query.
   1. Limiting by a BroadcastRef allows you to retrieve faxes contained in a group of send requests
   2. Limiting by SendRef allows you to retrieve faxes contained in a single send request
   3. Limitting by MessageRef allows you to retrieve a single fax message
There are multiple levels of verbosity available in the request; these are explained in detail below. You can also find full examples below.
FaxStatusRequest Parameters:
Name
	Required
	Type
	Description
	Default
	BroadcastRef
	

	String
	User-defined broadcast reference
	

	SendRef
	

	String
	User-defined send reference
	

	MessageRef
	

	String 
	User-defined message reference
	

	Verbosity
	

	String
	The level of detail in the status response. Please see below for a list of possible values.
	brief
	

Verbosity Levels:
Value
	Description
	brief
	Gives you an overall view of the messages. This simply shows very high-level statistics, consisting of counts of how many faxes are at each status (i.e. processing, queued, sending) and totals of the results of these faxes (success, failed, blocked).
	send
	Includes the results from “brief” while also including an itemised list of each fax message in the request
	details
	Includes the results from “send” along with details of the parameters used to send the fax messages
	results
	Includes the results from “send” along with the sending results of the fax messages
	all
	Includes the results from both “details” and “results” along with some extra uncommon fields
